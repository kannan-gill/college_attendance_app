# college_attendance_app
Hello, as our minor project we submitted a touchless entry system for corona. We included face mask detection in it, swiping rf id card to get entry. And live attendance being recorded on the website which can be accessed only by the professor. Several things were taken care off like only one attendance would be given in one day independent of rf id swipes. Also no attendance would be given if someone is 20 minutes late. This was followed by opening of the door and spray of sanitizers. My part in the code was regarding the website. Here is the code for that.
